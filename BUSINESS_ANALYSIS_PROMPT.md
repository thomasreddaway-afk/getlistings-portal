**Why this pivot makes sense:**
- Mobile apps are limited by screen real estate
- 30% App Store fees are brutal on margins
- Web portal allows for proper data visualisation
- Upsell/cross-sell is nearly impossible in-app
- Enterprise/agency features don't work on mobile
- Older agents (our core demo) prefer desktop
- Integration with external tools easier on web
- No app store review delays for updates

**Competitive landscape:**
- Most competitors are basic CRM or lead lists
- No one doing AI seller scoring at this level
- Portal allows us to differentiate with AI features
- Premium pricing justified by exclusive data + AI
